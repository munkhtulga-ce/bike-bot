BikeBot Insurance Services: Protect Your Ride, Protect Your Peace of Mind

Your bike is more than just a set of wheels — it’s your freedom, your commute, your weekend escape. At BikeBot, we understand how valuable your ride is, which is why we offer comprehensive, flexible insurance plans tailored specifically for cyclists.

🛡️ What We Cover
BikeBot Insurance is designed to protect you from the most common — and costly — risks of bicycle ownership. Our policies include:

✅ Theft Coverage
Covers theft of your entire bicycle, whether it’s at home, at work, or on the street (as long as it was secured properly).

Optional coverage for stolen accessories (e.g., lights, panniers, GPS units).

✅ Accidental Damage
Covers damage from crashes, drops, or collisions — including frame cracks, bent wheels, broken parts, and more.

Includes coverage whether you're riding or transporting your bike.

✅ Vandalism
Protection against intentional damage caused by third parties.

✅ Third-Party Liability
Covers you if you accidentally cause injury or damage to someone else or their property while riding.

✅ Roadside Assistance (Optional Add-on)
Emergency pickup and repair coordination if your bike breaks down mid-ride and you’re stranded.

✅ Race & Event Coverage (Optional Add-on)
Insurance valid during organized cycling events and races.

❌ What’s Not Covered
We believe in transparency. Here’s what our standard plans don’t include:

Normal wear and tear or gradual deterioration (e.g., worn tires, brake pads, chain stretch)

Cosmetic damage that doesn’t affect function (e.g., minor scratches)

Theft when the bike wasn’t properly locked

Use of the bike for commercial delivery unless added to your plan

Pre-existing damage or repairs made without authorization

Damage resulting from illegal activity or racing (unless optional race coverage is purchased)
